~~1. Change addEdge() to use append instead of push_back~~

==== Part 2: Building a graph ====
1. Ask what is a list of users (main: line 11) on Tuesday

~~2. Create a graph using Graph.h/.cpp~~
    ~~- Must include all 10 products~~

    ~~- Vertex 0 should be product stored at index 0 in vector, etc...~~
    - Choose whether or not it is directed/undirected (OUR CHOICE, explain in a comment)

~~3. Assign random single value weight to all edges.~~

==== Part 3: Graph Topology ====
1. Plot graph on draw.io
